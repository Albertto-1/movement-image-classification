# movement-image-classification

This project uses different machine learning techniques to predict the shape of a movement (predict figures).
The available movements/figures are:

* Circle
* Triangle
* Infinity
* Square
* S_Shape
* Diamon

This project uses sklearn and tensorflow frameworks to train, test and predict multiple models.

The DLTrain.py was based in this [tensorflow image classification tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification#import_tensorflow_and_other_libraries).
